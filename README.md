# Synced Repository-Project Template
Repository with actions to automatically groom a project board.

Relies on 2 actions:
- [add-to-project](https://github.com/r1oga/repo-project-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/add-to-project.yml)  
  Based on [this marketplace action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/add-to-github-projects).  
  Any opened actions will be added to the configured project.
- [issue-link](https://github.com/r1oga/repo-project-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/issue-link.yml)  
  Based on [this marketplace action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/add-an-issue-link).  
  For any branch that starts with the prefix `issue-<number>`, the corresponding PR's text description will be automatically edited to link it to an existing issue.  
  _Note: linking the PR to the issue could actually be achieved manually like [this](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) too._
